=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::Cache::Page - Mojolicious plugin for caching page

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #Mojolicious

 $self->plugin('cache-page');

 #Mojolicious::Lite

  plugin 'cache-page';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin caches the entire output of controller action in a HTML file which can be
delivered directly by the webserver without even going through the controller at all. The
cache will generate files for example user/2/view.html,  user/new.html etc which matches
the request urls. The webserver picks up the existing file by matching the path otherwise
it gets passed to the mojolicious controller.

The cache is named according to path and so the cache will not differentiate between 
an identical page that is accessed from B<tucker.myplace.com/user/2/view.html>
and from B<caboose.myplace.com/user/2/view.html>. This caching system ignores the query
parameters. So,  for example /users?page=1 will be cached as users.html and so another
call to /users?page=2 will retrieve the users.html. The cache is expired by deleting the
html file that defered it creation until a new request comes in.
