NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Cache::Action - Mojolicious plugin for caching

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
    #Mojolicious $self->plugin('cache-action');

    #Mojolicious::Lite plugin 'cache-action';

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin caches responses of mojolicious applications. It works by
    caching the entire output of controller action for every request. Action
    caching internally uses the *before_dispatch* hook to serve the response
    from cache by skipping the entire controller body. Uncached responses
    are cached in an *after_dispatch* hook.

    The cache is named according to the current host and path. So, the cache
    will differentiate between an identical page that is accessed from
    tucker.myplace.com/user/2 and from caboose.myplace.com/user/2

    Different representation of the same resource such as
    tucker.myplace.com/book/list and tucker.myplace.com/book/list.json are
    considered as separate requests and so are cached separately.

  Cache backends
    This plugin uses CHI <http://http://search.cpan.org/~jswartz/CHI> for
    caching responses. So, all the various cache backends and customization
    options of CHI are supported. By default, this plugin uses the Memory
    <http://search.cpan.org/~jswartz/CHI-0.36/lib/CHI/Driver/Memory.pm>
    cache backend. Various other backends

    *   <http://search.cpan.org/~jswartz/CHI-0.36/lib/CHI/Driver/File.pm|Fil
        e>
